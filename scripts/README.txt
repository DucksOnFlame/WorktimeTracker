If you prefer to have an easier access to WorktimeTracker copy these simple commands to the same folder as WorktimeTracker.jar

startWorktimeTracker.bat - simply starts the app so you don't have to run it from the command line yourself

clockOutAndShutDown.bat - automatically clocks you out and shuts down your computer

It is also advised to copy a shortcut to the first script to your startup folder. That is usually located in:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

That way, when you first log in to your computer the app will automatically log your arrival time. Otherwise you will have to do it manually.
