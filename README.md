WHAT DOES THIS DO?

WorktimeTracker is a simple command line tool to help you track your worktime. If you follow the recommended flow described below it will log your arrival and departure automatically (via provided scripts). If you want to learn about the available features simply start it up and all commands will be displayed to you.

HOW TO USE IT?

1. Copy the WorktimeTracker.jar file from "out\artifacts\WorktimeTracker_jar" to your prefered location.
2. Run the .jar file via command line or via provided scripts described below.

OPTIONAL SCRIPTS

If you prefer to have an easier access to WorktimeTracker copy these simple commands to the same folder as WorktimeTracker.jar

The files are located in the /scripts/ folder for your convenience.

startWorktimeTracker.bat - simply starts the app so you don't have to run it from the command line yourself
clockOutAndShutDown.bat - automatically clocks you out and shuts down your computer. Recommended to use instead of normal PC shutdown so that you don't have to log your departure manually.

It is also advised to copy a shortcut to the first script to your startup folder. That is most commonly located in:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

That way, when you first log in to your computer the app will automatically log your arrival time. Otherwise you will have to do it manually.
